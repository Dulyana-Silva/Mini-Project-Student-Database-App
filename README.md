# Student Database App (JDBC)
---

## ⚙️ Project Overview
This is a simple **console-based Java application** that allows managing student records (Add, View, Update, Delete) using **JDBC** to connect with a MySQL database.

The project demonstrates basic **CRUD operations** and serves as a mini-project for understanding how Java applications interact with relational databases.



## 🚀 Features
- Add new student records  
- View all students  
- Update existing student details  
- Delete student records  
- JDBC connectivity with MySQL  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java 
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL
- SQL

## 🔑 Important Notes
- The *id* field is an AUTO_INCREMENT primary key.
- This means that once a record is **deleted**, its ID is **not reused.**
- This is **normal behavior** in MySQL and ensures data consistency.
